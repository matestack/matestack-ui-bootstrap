# matestack-ui-bootstrap | beautiful UIs in pure Ruby

As an extension for [`matestack-ui-core`](https://github.com/matestack/matestack-ui-core), `matestack-ui-bootstrap` ships all you need to build beautiful,
reactive UIs in pure Ruby and smart CRUD components based on Bootstrap v5.

`matestack-ui-core` enables you to craft maintainable web UIs in pure Ruby, skipping ERB and HTML. UI code becomes a native and fun part of your Rails app. Thanks to reactive core components, reactivity can be optionally added on top without writing JavaScript, just using a simple Ruby DSL.

You end up writing 50% less code while increasing productivity, maintainability and developer happiness. Work with pure Ruby. If necessary, extend with pure JavaScript. No Opal involved.

`matestack-ui-core` does not have an opinion on styling
Don't think about styling anymore and just create admin or application UIs faster than ever before!

The main goals are:

- More maintainable UI code, using a component-based structure written in Ruby
- Increased development speed and happiness, offering prebuilt UI-Components for typical requirements
- Modern, dynamic UI feeling without the need to implement a separate JavaScript Application

`matestack-ui-core` can progressively replace the classic Rails-View-Layer. You are able to use
it alongside your classic views and incrementally turn your Rails-App into a
dynamic Web-App.
